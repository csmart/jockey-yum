    - Add NoDisplay=true to autostart .desktop file and have jockey-gtk show up
      in Unity. Thanks Mike Terry.

jockey (0.9.2-0ubuntu7) oneiric; urgency=low

  * data/handlers/nvidia.py: Properly check invalid alternatives and the
    parent class' enabled() method, to avoid showing the nvidia driver as
    enabled when it is not even installed.
  * data/handlers/fglrx.py: Check invalid alternative, too.
  * data/handlers/nvidia.py: Check multiarch alternatives as well. Thanks
    Alberto Milone!
  * data/handlers/nvidia.py: Fix crash if the free driver alternative is None.

  * Convert build system to dh7, using the new dh-translations.
  * Move to GTK3:

jockey (0.9.2-0ubuntu5) natty; urgency=low

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * data/handlers/nvidia.py: Fix broken condition in used(), which would be
    True already if the package was merely installed. (LP: #759804)
  * jockey/oslib.py, ignored_modules(): Drop linux-ubuntu-modules, gone long
    ago.
  * Cherry-pick r720 from trunk to support a new --kernel option on the
    backend and frontend with --no-dbus. This allows ubiquity to install a PAE
    kernel on the target system and tell jockey to install kernel headers for
    that one instead for the running one. Based on a patch from Evan Dandrea,
    thanks! (LP: #759804)
  * Cherry-pick r721 from trunk: OpenPrintingDriverDB: Use the actual package
    version as "version" attribute instead of the driver name. This was a bit
    of a thinko back then. Update test cases accordingly. (LP: #744751)

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * jockey/oslib.py: Disconnect from Debconf before installing packages.
    (LP: #759804)

jockey (0.9.2-0ubuntu4) natty; urgency=low

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * data/handlers/nvidia.py: Some cleanup:
    - Drop obsolete add_modules=['glx'].
    - Drop setting DefaultDepth=24, X.org does that by default now.
    - Move version 96 specific code to NvidiaDriver96 class.
    - Remove some dead code.
  * Merge from trunk:
    - XorgDriverHandler: Support None X.org driver to avoid changing the
      Driver setting. This is appropriate for drivers which X.org conf
      autodetects.
    - Add new flag Handler.needs_kernel_headers and install kernel headers if
      set.
  * data/handlers/{nvidia,fglrx}.py: Stop setting the X.org driver and
    alternate free driver. Natty's X.org now prefers the proprietary drivers
    over the free ones when available (105_nvidia_fglrx_autodetect.patch).
    This allows X.org to fall back to the free driver if the proprietary one
    gets broken or out of sync. (LP: #522061)
  * jockey/oslib.py: Set kernel header metapackage name from currently running
    kernel flavour, and add a small test case that it is a valid package.
  * data/handlers/{nvidia,fglrx}.py: Replace custom code to install kernel
    headers with setting the needs_kernel_headers flag.
  * data/handlers/broadcom_wl.py: Set needs_kernel_headers flag. (LP: #567699)
  * jockey/oslib.py, install_packages(): python-apt recently changed
    "architecture" field of a candidate Version; where it used to say "all"
    it now has the platform name. So switch to
    candidate.record['Architecture'] to check if a package is Arch: all. This
    unbreaks installation of unsigned third-party PPD packages.

  [ Alberto Milone ]
  * data/handlers/fglrx.py:
    - Re-enable fglrx.
    - Replace tabs with whitespaces.
  * data/handlers/nvidia.py:
    - Replace tabs with whitespaces.

jockey (0.9.2-0ubuntu2) natty; urgency=low

  * Merge from trunk:
    - Reintroduce __fix_stdouterr(); we need it for proper -l unicode support.
      However, delay it until after OptParser, as an already encoded
      sys.stderr causes that to crash. (LP: #728744)

jockey (0.9.2-0ubuntu1) natty; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - Add X.org video driver ABI checking. (This was already cherrypicked
      in an earlier upload)
    - Drop our own verified_https.py and implement GPG fingerprint SSL
      checking with pycurl, which gets along with proxies. (LP: #729185)
    - Some code cleanup and more test cases.
  * debian/control: Add python-pycurl dependency.

jockey (0.9.1-0ubuntu4) natty; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Move nvidia-common back to Recommends, as this is only

jockey (0.9.1-0ubuntu3) natty; urgency=low

  * Merge from trunk:
    - Add X.org video driver ABI checking
  * jockey/oslib.py: Implement current_xorg_video_abi() and
    video_driver_abi() for Ubuntu.
  * data/handlers/nvidia.py: Drop (already commented out) disabling due to ABI
    mismatch. With above code, this check now happens dynamically, also works
    for third-party repos, and we can stop having to update the handler each
    time the ABIs get out of sync.

  * jockey/oslib.py, install_packages(): Fix crash with third-party
    repositories that do not have a trusted origin. (LP: #712685)
  * Merge fixes from trunk:
    - Add --no-dbus UI option. This will use a local Backend instance
      instead of communicating with the D-BUS backend interface. This is
      suitable for installers where jockey needs to run in a chroot.
      (LP: #723223)
    - ui.py: Drop __fix_stdouterr(), we are using gettext in unicode
      mode, and this leads to crashes with --help.
    - ui.py: Show translated driver names with --list

  * debian/control: Wrap dependencies.
  * debian/control: Drop obsolete python-xdg dependency.
  * debian/control: Drop unnecessary XB-Python-Version headers from -gtk and

    - Move HTTP sever for test suite to separate module for easier reuse.
    - tests: Skip online OSLib tests when being offline
    - OSLib.install_package(): Fix exception for unknown package
    - Add a demo GPG key to tests/, for testing signed archives
    - OSLib tests: use local test keyserver
  * jockey/oslib.py, install_package(): Don't just require specifying a

jockey (0.7-0ubuntu2) natty; urgency=low

  * jockey/oslib.py: Add proper progress feedback for updating the apt
    indexes.
  * jockey/oslib.py: Use apt.Cache.update()'s undocumented, but awesome
    sources_list argument to only update jockey's apt sources, not the entire
    system's. This dramatically speeds up driver installation. Adjust
    index/download/install accordingly (10%/40%/50% now).

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 07 Jan 2011 15:43:16 +0100

jockey (0.7-0ubuntu1) natty; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Add support for repository fingerprints, and retrieve them from
      openprinting.org when available.
    - Allow binary drivers if they have a valid GPG fingerprint on a trusted
      https:// site. This is a lot weaker than our usual archive trust chain,
      but as it's very hard to get a chain of trust to printer driver vendors,
      relying on good SSL certificates is the next best step, and still much
      better than what the average user does when searching and downloading a
      driver by himself.
    - Add API for retrieving and installing a GPG key based on a fingerprint.
    - Merge add_repository() into install_package(), which is much more
      practical for verifying whether a package in a new repository ist
      trustworthy.
  * jockey/oslib.py, tests/oslib.py: Update for merged add_repository(), and
    implement GPG retrieval and repository trust checking. This now provides
    secure binary third-party drivers. (LP: #604698)
  * tests/oslib.py, test_ubuntu_package_header_modaliases(): Fix typo in
    regular expression which didn't catch "fglrx" before.
  * data/handlers/fglrx.py, data/handlers/nvidia.py: Disable these two
    handlers in a live system environment (if /rofs exists). We will most
    likely run out of RAM trying to download, build, and install all the
    packages in the RAM disk. (LP: #685017)

  * data/handlers/nvidia.py:
    - Re-enable nvidia-96 now that it's compatible with xserver 1.9.
      (LP: #626974).

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * New upstream release 0.6:
    - Add support and test case for reading modaliases from package headers.
    - Put back "Additional Drivers" progress window title. Thanks Bilal
      Akhtar! (LP: #323815)
    - jockey/detection.py, get_hardware(): Disable printer detection.
      cupshelpers.getDevices() is excruciatingly slow (about 15 seconds), and
      jockey is not normally used directly to install printer drivers.
      Instead, system-config-printer picks up new printers, and calls jockey
      with the device ID, so jockey does not need to detect printers by
      itself.
    - jockey-kde: Use runtime .ui loading instead of pykdeuic4; the latter
      just keeps breaking.
    - gtk/jockey-gtk.ui: Drop obsolete has_separator property; Explicitly set
      topmost GtkVBox fill property to True, as the default changed in GTK 3.0
      (GNOME #634592)
    - Various test suite fixes.
  * debian/control: Drop now obsolete python-{qt4,kde}* build dependencies.
  * debian/jockey-kde.install: Install the KDE *.ui files.
  * jockey/oslib.py, has_repositories(): Greatly speed up (5 seconds â†’
    negligible) by calling "apt-cache policy" instead of creating an
    apt.Cache() object.
  * Drop data/handlers/b43.py, our linux-firmware package ships the b43
    firmware now. Also, the wl driver is generally a lot better.
  * Add support for putting modalias definitions in driver package's
    debian/control, so that we can replace the /usr/share/jockey/modaliases/*
    lists with lookups in the package database (see blueprint
    hardware-desktop-n-package-field-modaliases). With this we can drop the
    foo-modaliases packages, and shipping third-party driver packages will
    just work in Jockey without any further integration.
    - Add debian/debhelper/dh_jockey: Debhelper program to produce a
      ${modaliases} substvar from scanning .ko files or
      debian/packagename.modaliases.
    - Add debian/debhelper/test_dh_jockey: Automatic test script for
      dh_jockey.
    - Add debian/debhelper/modaliases.pm: dh_auto sequencer for dh_modaliases.
    - debian/control: Add dh-modaliases package.
    - debian/dh-modaliases.install: Install dh_modaliases and modaliases.pm.
    - debian/rules: Create manpage from dh_modaliases POD.
    - jockey/oslib.py: Add apt implementation for package_header_modaliases().
    - tests/oslib.py: Add test case for our package_header_modaliases()
      implementation. This only really tests anything if there is at least one
      package with a "Modaliases:" field in the local apt repository.
  * jockey/oslib.py: Change deprecated apt.apt_pkg.Config.Set() to .set().
  * debian/rules: Drop simple-patchsys.mk, we don't need it (patches are
    inline, maintained in bzr).

  * Add support for bypassing local detection for search_driver(). (Merged

  * jockey/ui.py: Ubuntu does not currently support local printer driver

      target_alternative. This caused jockey to skip the condition
      that we really wanted to test (i.e. do the two alternatives
      match?) and show the driver as enabled when the target
      alternative didn't exist (as the package hadn't been installed
      yet) (LP: #562226).

  * Do not check that the module is loaded in enabled() in the nvidia
    handler, as this is what we should do in used(). Just make sure
    that the module and its alias are not blacklisted. This prevents
    Jockey from claiming that the installation of nvidia driver failed
    when when it didn't (LP: #552653).

  * data/handlers/fglrx.py:
    - Re-enable the fglrx handler and make it use the alternatives system
      (LP: #496225).
  * data/handlers/nvidia.py:
    - See if the module alias is loaded and then check what module it
      corresponds to in order to see if it's really enabled (LP: #547066).
      This involved overriding the enabled() and the used() methods.
  * jockey/xorg_driver.py:
    - Simplify the logic in the enabled() method by only relying on
      X-Kit's isDriverEnabled() method. This will avoid getting false
      positives in the case in which the 1st Device section (i.e. the
      only one that we used to check) uses the right driver but the
      same section is irrelevant as it's not mentioned in the
      ServerLayout section.

    - backend.py: Rewrite timeout behaviour for more robustness; do not time
      out right after a long method call.
    - Intercept crashes of the backend (which manifest as D-BUS NoReply
      error), present an error message, and restart backend. (LP: #273600)
    - jockey-gtk: Fix crash if nothing is selected in the tree view after an
      operation. (LP: #283887)
    - fglrx.py: Unconfigured driver defaults to ati, which already provides
      compositing. (LP: #285879)
  * jockey/oslib.py, install_package(): Use --force-confnew to fix hang/crash
    on "EOF on stdin at conffile prompt", since the jockey backend does not
    have any terminal or interactivity. This fixes fglrx install failure when
    the upstream installer was previously used. This still keeps .dpkg-old
    configuration backups, and using a tool like Jockey should "make it work".
    (LP: #283765)
  * data/handlers/b43.py: Add missing OSLib import. (LP: #295530)

  * Merge bug fix from trunk:
    - nvidia.py: Drop constructor check for unsupported legacy versions; at
      ctor invocation time, the package is not set yet, and this check
      should not be upstream in the first place.
    - detection.py: Do not instantiate handlers from DriverDBs which are
      unavailable. (Pre-requisite for fixing LP #288662)

jockey (0.5~beta3-0ubuntu2) intrepid; urgency=low

  * Merge bug fixes from trunk:
    - OpenPrintingDriverDB: Filter out HTML tags from names, they look ugly
      and <br> even breaks the display.
    - jockey-gtk: Increase the default width of the license dialog to fit a
      standard 80 column text.
    - ui.py, search_driver(): Increase timeout from default 30 seconds to 10
      minutes, since driver DB lookup can last quite long (crash fix).
    - OpenPrintingDriverDB: Disambiguate drivers by their driver name, not by
      supplier; fixes e. g. splix stable vs. development version conflict.
    - Backend available(), search_drivers(): Show the recommended drivers
      first, so that the default GUI selection will not point to a
      non-recommended one by default.

jockey (0.5~beta3-0ubuntu1) intrepid; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release 0.5 beta 3. Compared to our bzr snapshot,
    this has the following changes:
    - OpenPrintingDriverDB: Show non-recommended drivers, too, but mark the
      recommended one appropriately. (LP: #271286)
    - get_handlers(): If there is just one driver for a HardwareID, do not
      present it as recommended even if the Driver DB marks it as such, since
      it is just confusing.
    - jockey-gtk: If jockey shipped icons are not available (happens in some
      third-party themes), fall back to stock icons instead of crashing.
      (LP: #283363)
  * oslib.py, package_name(): Remove intra-paragraph line breaks; both GUIs
    already do their own line breaking according to the widget width, and
    having them in between looks ugly.

jockey (0.5~beta2-0ubuntu3) intrepid; urgency=low

  * Merge change from trunk:
    - openprinting.org lookup: Only search for packaged PPD files, not for
      cups filters. This is to greatly reduce the potential conflict with
      distro packages (until the openprinting.org ones get properly
      namespaced), and also because those filters should generally be supplied
      as proper Ubuntu packages.

      long description. (LP: #269454)
    - backend.py, set_enabled(): Report progress signals early when handling
      packages, to avoid delays until package manager sends out the first
      progress. (LP: #279073)
  * data/handlers/fglrx.py: Enable driver again, current version works now.
    Also add "Recommends: fglrx-modaliases", so that detection works in a
    default installation. (LP: #262819)

  * jockey/oslib.py: Clean up error handling on package installation/removal.

    - Further clarify fglrx rationale.
    - Make the nvidia handler raise an AssertionError if the version of the
      driver is < 173, since they do not work with current X.org. [Alberto]
  * data/handlers/broadcom_wl.py: Fix crash if wl module is not available.
    (LP: #280929)
  * data/handlers/fglrx.py: Raise an exception in the ctor, pointing at
    LP#247376, since current xorg-driver-fglrx is busted. If this gets fixed
    in -updates, this needs to be reverted, and a recommends: to
    fglrx-modaliases needs to be added.

      driver for a particular hardware component with getting GUI.
    - Full backend integration of OpenPrinting.org driver search.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * jockey/oslib.py: Use python-apt instead of calling apt-get, to get numeric
    progress reporting instead of just pulsating.
  * Add python-apt dependency, Ubuntu oslib.py uses it now.
  * Bump Standards-Version (no changes).
  * Bump debhelper build dependency version for dh_icons, thanks lintian.
  * jockey/oslib.py: Provide an apt implementation for

jockey (0.4-0ubuntu1) intrepid; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.4:
    - Implements an XML-RPC client for querying a driver database, as
      specified on this year's LinuxFoundation Collaboration Summit. There is
      no server implementation for this yet, though.
    - Add general support for third-party repositories and packages not yet
      known to the local system. In the course of this, the functionality of
      DriverPackageHandler became merged into the generic Handler class, and
      ModulePackageHandler became obsolete (KernelModuleHandler now does all
      of this). This made the code a bit shorter and easier, too.
    - Add support for python-coverage in the test suite, and add a lot of
      missing tests.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Update to current trunk bzr head:
    - Split into privileged D-BUS backend and unprivileged frontends, control
      access with PolicyKit. This gets rid of the nasty "gksu/kdesu myself"
      code, and makes the service more useful for other desktop applications
      which look for drivers.
    - Support fourth field in modalias files for specifying a package name (as
      done by nvidia-XX-modaliases packages).
    - Update NVidia handler to get along with the multiple-versions packages
      in Intrepid.
  * debian/jockey-common.install: Install D-BUS and PolicyKit configuration
    files, and jockey-backend program.
  * data/handlers/b43.py: Update to new upstream infrastructure.
  * jockey/oslib.py: Reimplement {install,remove}_package() using simple
    apt-get calls, with no precise progress information. This is a
    quick'n'dirty hack for Intrepid Alpha-3, so that the user at least gets
    some kind of visual feedback on package installation. This will be cleaned
    up later.
  * debian/control: Add python-dbus, policykit dependencies to -common, and
    policykit-gnome dependency to -gtk.
  * debian/control: Recommend nvidia-common to provide out-of-the-box
    detection of nvidia cards, and their matching driver.

  * debian/jockey-common.postinst: Remove old restricted-manager autostart XDG
    file on upgrades.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 03 Apr 2008 18:07:22 +0200

jockey (0.3.3-0ubuntu3) hardy; urgency=low

  * jockey/oslib.py: Do not set debconf priority to critical any more.
    b43-fwcutter needs the "download firmware" question shown in order to
    actually download the firmware, and we do not need it ATM for other
    packages. (LP: #197819)

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 03 Apr 2008 14:49:12 +0200

jockey (0.3.3-0ubuntu2) hardy; urgency=low

  * Merge to upstream trunk to pick up a few bug fixes:
    - nvidia.py: Add AddARGBGLXVisuals option to Screen section for
      nvidia-glx.  (LP: #154596)
    - nvidia.py: Do not advertise as enabling composite if driver is already
      loaded (i. e. installed manually). (LP: #202802)
    - fglrx.py: Do not suggest installing fglrx if using the radeon X.org
      driver, since that already supports composite (LP: #207957)
    - jockey/ui.py: Change --update-db to print an error message instead of
      exception (LP: #209594)
    - If rebinding a module fails, trigger reboot notification. (LP: #207928)

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 01 Apr 2008 20:40:50 +0200

jockey (0.3.3-0ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - jockey/xorg_driver.py: Check if _row attribute is present, which is not
      the case for Subsections in the "Module" section. (LP: #201160)
    - Make --check-composite ask for confirmation. (LP: #202898)
    - Enable AddARGBGLXVisuals option for standard nvidia driver.
      (LP: #154596)
    - KDE: Do not change check boxes  if enabling was cancelled.
    - KDE: Drop unicode() conversion in confirm_action(), strings are already
      unicode (LP: #206169)
    - KDE: Disable help button if help is not available. (LP #206169)

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 27 Mar 2008 12:41:53 +0100

jockey (0.3.2-0ubuntu3) hardy; urgency=low

  * Cherrypick some bug fixes from trunk:
    - Add automatic testing for all shipped custom handlers in examples/ and
      data/handlers/. So far the test suite only covered the standard
      handlers.
    - This uncovered that the fglrx and nvidia handlers still crash if
      xorg.conf does not have a Screen section; fixed for real now.
      (LP: #200832)
  * data/handlers/b43.py: Add missing import (also uncovered by above test
    suite). (LP: #203958)

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 20 Mar 2008 16:30:32 +0100

jockey (0.3.2-0ubuntu2) hardy; urgency=low

  * Final 0.3.2 release (previous Ubuntu upload had a botched version number)
    with bug fixes only (no new features). This time also with orig.tar.gz
    again.
    - fglrx, nvidia handlers: Create screen section if it does not exist.
      (LP: #200832)
    - Abort gracefully with a proper error message if cache directory does not
      exist. (LP: #198433)
    - ui.py, check(): Intercept ValueError from package query. This can happen
      if the daily apt cron job runs while jockey is running as well and
      temporarily causes inconsistent package indexes. (LP: #200089)
    - kde/jockey-kde, comfirm_action(): Fix string formatting. (LP: #197777)
    - jockey/oslib.py: Fix calling of kdesu.
    - kde/jockey-kde: Make --check notifications actually work (LP: #193985)
    - Fix the KDE interface test suite.
  * debian/rules: Fix apport hook file name.
  * debian/apport_hook.py: Add missing import.
  * data/handlers/b43.py: Consider driver enabled if firmware files are
    installed; testing whether b43-fwcutter is installed (the default
    behaviour of ModulePackageHandler) is incorrect here. (LP: #198341)

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 18 Mar 2008 17:28:32 +0100

jockey (0.3.2-0ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release for KDE frontend changes:
    - Add Oxygen icon
    - Resize columns to text
    - Nodes expanded by default

 -- Ryan Kavanagh <ryanakca@kubuntu.org>  Thu, 13 Mar 2008 19:26:16 +0000

jockey (0.3.1-0ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - Fix 'used' detection of nVidia driver.
    - Add README.txt.
    - Create default xorg.conf if it does not exist.
    - More efficient modalias data structures for great detection stage
      speedup (typically from > 5 to about 1 second).
    - Run --check with niceness 10 and change autostart desktop files to delay
      it by a minute, so that it does not slow down session startup.
    - Fix --enable and --disable to not ask for confirmation, otherwise they
      are useless in noninteractive scripts.
  * oslib.py: Cache "apt-cache show" results.
  * oslib.py: If we do not have a $DISPLAY, just call apt-get, not
    x-terminal-emulator.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 10 Mar 2008 15:42:03 +0100

jockey (0.3-0ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  * Merge with trunk to update to the 0.3 release. We already had all the new
    features like the KDE interface, so this only imports bug fixes, in
    particular:
    - Update fglrx handler for current upstream version, to actually work
      again at all (DisplayDepth) and declare support for composite. Thanks to
      Sander Jonkes! (LP: #194963)
    - Quiesce backtraces from failed handler instantiation. (LP: #195548)
    - Use regular expressions, not fnmatch for modalias pattern matching,
      since we do not want to treat '[' and ']' specially. (LP: #193521)
    - Port --enable and --disable options from restricted-manager.
      (LP: #181832)
    - Port --check-composite from restricted-manager. (LP: #193978)
  * Fixed Vcs-Bzr field.
  * Remove do-release from this branch, it's only useful for upstream
    developers on trunk and confusing in the package.
  * debian/jockey-common.postinst: Remove --check cache on upgrade from 
    << 0.3, since the format changed (much more robust now).

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 04 Mar 2008 16:48:50 +0100

jockey (0.2-0ubuntu6) hardy; urgency=low

  * rebuild due to python-central issue

 -- Sebastien Bacher <seb128@canonical.com>  Tue, 19 Feb 2008 22:08:52 +0100

jockey (0.2-0ubuntu5) hardy; urgency=low

  * Add debug logging for enabled() to XorgDriver and ModulePackageHandler.
    (Cherrypicked from trunk)
  * Make window title consistent to .desktop files. (LP: #189689)
    (Cherrypicked from trunk)

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 19 Feb 2008 09:38:46 +0100

jockey (0.2-0ubuntu4) hardy; urgency=low

  * Merged Martin BÃ¶hm's KDE implementation, thanks a lot!

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 14 Feb 2008 18:55:10 +0100

jockey (0.2-0ubuntu3) hardy; urgency=low

  * At least on current kernel, devices on the SSB bus do not produce modalias
    files, they just mention it in 'uevent'. Add detection for those, so that
    autodetection of Broadcom wifis (b43 driver) works. (Cherrypicked from
    trunk).
  * Do not ignore custom handlers which wrap a standard kernel module (which
    are ignored by default). (Cherrypicked from trunk)
  * Add data/handlers/b43.py: Handler for the b43 Broadcom Wifi module.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 11 Feb 2008 09:58:23 +0100

jockey (0.2-0ubuntu2) hardy; urgency=low

  * Stop running the tests during build, they need too many build deps.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 05 Feb 2008 09:30:48 +0100

jockey (0.2-0ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - Do not create default handlers for nonexisting kernel modules.
      (LP: #187148)
    - Suppress exceptions (like SIGPIPE) in logging. (LP: #188658)
    - Enable UseEdidFreqs for legacy NVidia driver. (LP: #151141)
    - Set proper window icon. (LP: #187073)
    - Clean up strings in .desktop files (LP: #150205)
    - Fix test suite exit code on success.
    - Do not set AddARGB{,GLX}Visuals options in standard and new nVidia
      handler any more (obsolete).
    - Support hiding of help button if help is not available.
  * tests/oslib.py: Add simple tests for Ubuntu implementation of package
    system query functions.
  * jockey/oslib.py, package_description(): Do not crash when apt-cache show
    succeeds, but prints nothing. This works around apt bug #18306.
    (LP: #186943)
  * tests/oslib.py: Add shallow test cases for {install,remove}_packge() to
    ensure that they won't crash for the simplest reasons. This reproduces
    #186584.
  * jockey/oslib.py: Add missing import of time. (LP: #186584, #186883)
  * jockey/oslib.py, ui_help_available(): Only show help if yelp is present.
    (LP: #186179)
  * debian/rules: Run test suite during build (failure causes FTBFS).

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 04 Feb 2008 18:53:26 +0100

jockey (0.1-0ubuntu1) hardy; urgency=low

  * First upstream release 0.1:
    - Add installed_packages status file, so that the ubiquity hook actually
      works.
    - Add test suite for GTK frontend (run through all widgets).
    - Import usable translations from restricted-manager.
    - Some internal code architecture cleanup.
    - Some bug fixes, particularly in FirmwareHandler and build system.
  * debian/rules: Remove POT on clean.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 31 Jan 2008 12:53:36 +0100

jockey (0.1~r139) hardy; urgency=low

  * Add missing python-distutils-extra dependency.

 -- Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 25 Jan 2008 09:20:43 +0000

jockey (0.1~r118) hardy; urgency=low

  * Initial release, result of completely rewriting restricted-manager to be
    maintainable, robust, and suitable for other distributions. Some features
    and the KDE UI still need to be ported.
  * See restricted-manager-rewrite specification for details.
